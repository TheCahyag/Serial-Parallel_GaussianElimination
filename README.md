Project: Gaussian Elimination Parallization  
Author: Brandon Bires-Navel (brn5915@rit.edu)  

Required:  
    Java 8  
    
To run the program double-click the Gaussian_Elimination.jar   
in an explorer window (finder on macOS).  

This will open a GUI window that will allow selecting the size of the matrix, 
whether the execution will be parallel or serial, the times to run the execution 
and the upper and lower bounds of the values inserted into the matrix. Once the
desired settings have been selected, click execute and a popup will display. 
Nothing will be displayed until the execution has finished. If you want to run 
multiple exections all with different parameters at the same time you will need 
to launch the jar file.
